Hello Everyone! I created this server to help pepole who can't get ChatGPT to be able to use it's HTML. If you want to me to add a code, join the Discord server and
ask in the #request thread and I will try to add most (approptate) request. I update this ATLEAST once in three days so I should get back to every request. 
Thanks for checking this out, and good luck coding to all of you!
